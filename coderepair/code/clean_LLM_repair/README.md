# Automated Program Repair in the Era of Large Pre-trained Language Models

This repo contains both the patches generated by my study along with the code used to run the experiment

### Patch Generation

You can find the main patch generation logic in `Repair` folder

#### Local model generations
Example usage to run repair:
```
python -m Repair.LM.repair \
  --model_name Salesforce/codet5-base \
  --batch_size 1 \
  --suffix \
  --dataset quixbug-python \
  --chances 200 \
  --folder Results/quixbug_ct5_infill
```



### Patch Validation

The validation function can be found in the `Dataset` folder with the appropriate function to validate each of the repair dataset

Example usage: 
from Dataset.validate_quixbug import validate_all_patches
validate_all_patches("Results/quixbug_ct5_infill", "lm_repair.json")
